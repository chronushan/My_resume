    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I am both an outdoor person and an indoor person. I enjoy physical activities such as going to the gym, taking a long walk while listening to music, and riding my bike around wherever I feel like exploring. I also enjoy staying at my house, and do static activities such as watching movies, playing videogames, and taking online courses on Web Development. I also enjoy cooking and sometimes drawing (I have a drawing instagram account!). </p>
